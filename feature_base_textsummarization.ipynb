    "document=\"Hi Steve  Thank you so much for reaching out and taking the time to send us feedback! It is very much appreciated! Please excuse the delayed response. Unfortunately, these scanning issues mostly occur due to older scanning technologies still used by some stores. Some devices (e.g. laser scanners or flatbed scanners) have difficulties reading smartphone displays. We hope to be able to solve this problem soon though as most stores will hopefully replace these scanning devices with newer image-based scanners in the course of their next cash system update. Until then, you can always ask the store staff to type in the card number manually in these cases so that you don't miss out on any rewards points or discounts. In the meantime, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.  Once again, thank you for taking the time to contact us about this issue. If you have any further questions, suggestions for improvements or general feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us again.Best regards,Isabelle van Capelleveen Customer Support GmbH C-HUB / Hafenstra√üe 25-27 68159 Mannheim\""
