<h3>1.Text Cleaning </h3>
In text_cleaning.ipynb we will be learning how to prepare document before applying model or how to clean document and in last we will have document converted into tokenized words with their frequency  which we will be using in word2vec embedding(representation of words) for our models.
For more information just have a look at my sentiment_prediction_model_trained_on_imdb_reviews,in that in starting representation of sentence is basically frequency of those words in that data.
